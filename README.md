## Introduction
Many ICT applications and services, including those from the Semantic Web, rely on the Web for the exchange of data. Most rural areas of developing countries are not reached by the Web and its possibilities, while at the same time the ability to share knowledge has been identified as a key enabler for development. To make widespread knowledge sharing possible in these rural areas, the notion of the Web has to be downscaled based on the specific low-resource infrastructure in place. 

SPARQL over SMS is a solution for Web-like exchange of RDF data over low-bandwidth networks. This is made possible by a data compression method that combines generic compression strategies and strategies that use Semantic Web specific features to reduce the size of RDF before it is transferred over a low-bandwidth network. Although SPARQL over SMS is based on ICT4D cases, it is also applicable to low-bandwidth cases in general, including the Internet of Things (IoT).

Onno Valkering, Victor de Boer, Gossa LÃ´, Romy Blankendaal, and Stefan Schlobach. **[The Semantic Web in an SMS](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-49004-5_45)**. _Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management (EKAW 2016)_

## Features
The features that are currently supported:

#### Networks:
WiFi (HTTP), Cellular (SMS)

#### SPARQL Query Forms:
CONSTRUCT, ASK

#### SPARQL Update Forms:
INSERT DATA, DELETE DATA

## Getting Started
To install and run SPARQL over SMS with the default configuration:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/onnovalkering/sparql-over-sms.git && cd sparql-over-sms
$ chmod u+x sparqloversms.sh && ./sparqloversms.sh start
```

A Docker setup is also possible:
```
$ docker network create "sparqloversms"

$ docker run -dt --network "sparqloversms" -p 6379:6379 -name "sos-taskqueue" redis
$ docker run -dt --network "sparqloversms" -p 3020:3020 -name "sos-triplestore" onnovalkering/cliopatria
$ docker run -dt --network "sparqloversms" -p 8888:8888 -name "sos-service" onnovalkering/sparql-over-sms
```

### Requirements
To run SPARQL over SMS locally, at minimum, the following must be installed:

- Java 1.7+
- Maven 3.0+
- Python 3.4+
- Redis 3.2+

For the full set of features, a triple store is also required. Currently only [ClioPatria](https://github.com/ClioPatria/ClioPatria) is supported.
